# INTRO

1. What, Why ts? : 

    => Ts is typed Javascript
    => TypeScript adds types to JavaScript to help you speed up the development 
       by catching errors before you even run the JavaScript code.
    => Ts uses compilers unlike js, which allows to catch datatype commands
    => TypeScript also implements the future features of JavaScript.

2. Setup : 

    => Node.js – Node.js is the environment in which you will run the TypeScript compiler. 
    => TypeScript compiler – a Node.js module that compiles TypeScript into JavaScript.
       "npm i typescript"
    => To directly on Node.js without precompiling, you can use the ts-node module.
      "npm install -g ts-node"

3. Datatypes :

    A. boolean :
    
        => TypeScript boolean type has two values: true and false
        => let pending: boolean; 
            pending = true;

    B. Numbers :
     
        a. bigint : whole numbers larger than 253 – 1.
                    A Big integer literal has the n character at the end of an integer
            example : let big: bigint = 9007199254740991n;

        b. number : normal floating point number
            example : let a: number = 32.04;
